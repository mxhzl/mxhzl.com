Hello! This is the source code for my personal website [mxhzl.com](https://mxhzl.com).

Its very simple I think. It uses a combination of the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator and the [Zonelets](https://zonelets.net/) site template.

The only real work I did was to adapt the zonelets template to work with Zola.

If you like the way it looks, all credit goes to Marina Kittaka, the creator of Zonelets. If you like the way it functions, all credit goes to Vincent Prouillet, the creator of Zola. Much gratitude to them both!
