In no particular order, a list of things I use:

I built this website on a midnight, 13-inch, M3 MacBook Air.

I am currently typing this on a M4 Mac Mini. I found myself doing more coding and tech related work in my free time lately, and using my laptop while sitting at my desk was an ergonomic nightmare, so I picked up a Mac Mini and I like it so much that I am basically using it as my primary machine.

I also have a PC that I built myself ([parts list](/pc.html)). I refuse to do any coding on Windows and I like using my Mac Mini more, so it has been relegated to just being used for gaming.

My code editor situation is constantly evolving. Currently I am writing this in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and while its not the most "modern" option nor does it have the most robust packages, I like the performance and simplicity. Its good enough for most of my uses I think. Plus the Rust language integration is pretty good so far. At work I use [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) ([why?](https://vscodium.com/#why)) because the Ruby and JavaScript tooling is slightly better than sublime I think. For quick text edits, or anything in the terminal, I use [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/). I used to be a vim/neovim user but it takes SO MANY plugins to make neovim do all of the things people like it for, and I just didn't want to put the effort into learning or understanding lua. Helix does most of the things I want it to right out of the box. I haven't made the move to using it full time as my dedicated text editor in all cases, but maybe someday.

I have finally moved away from iTerm2 in favor of [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/). I found ghostty during my brief deep dive into the life of [Mitchell Hashimoto](@/posts/nixos.md) and I very much enjoy it. I like that I can check my ghostty config into my dotfiles repo and easily replicate my setup to a new machine (something that always had an extra step with iTerm2).

I write in several different programming languages depending on context and need, but right now, I prefer [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

If you are interested, my dotfiles live in this [repo](https://git.mxhzl.com/mxhzl/dotfiles).

I host most of my code projects (including this website) on my private [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) instance at [git.mxhzl.com](https://git.mxhzl.com) which is mirrored to my GitHub profile.
