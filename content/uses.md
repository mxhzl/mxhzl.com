In no particular order, a list of things I use:

I built this website (and am typing this currently) on a midnight, 13-inch, M3, 2024 MacBook Air.

Although most of the time I end up using the PC I built myself ([parts list](/pc.html)), but doing any kind of coding on Windows is a nightmare from which I would never wake.

I code using [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) (you can ready why [here](https://vscodium.com/#why)) or [neovim](https://neovim.io/) depending on the context and my mood. I usually play around with configuring neovim but then give up and use VSCodium because its what I am use to.

Despite the many alternatives, I still use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

I write in several different programming languages depending on context and need, but right now, I prefer [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (fun fact this site was made with a static site generator written in Rust).

If you are interested, my dotfiles live in this [repo](https://github.com/mxhzl/dotfiles).

On my GitHub profile are any other projects I feel comfortable sharing as well as the source code for this [site](https://github.com/mxhzl/mxhzl.com).
