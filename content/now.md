#### Now Playing (game): Pokemon Fire Red

Despite my ever growing backlog of contemporary games (I will get to you one day Episode Aigis), I've found myself wanting to replay old Pokemon games. I want to at least play up to Gen 3 and then maybe pick up the more recent ones again. I fell off Scarlet pretty hard because of the performance issues but maybe once the Switch 2 is out, it will run a bit better.

#### Now Playing (music): [softscars](https://music.apple.com/us/album/softscars/1692344143) by yeule

This is a little out of my wheelhouse (I am also very excited for the new PUP album coming out soon) but yeule hits the same part of my brain that Grimes did many years ago before she sold out a bit. I found yeule through the [soundtrack to I Saw the TV Glow](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_the_TV_Glow_(soundtrack)>) (a movie I desperately want to watch but am very afraid to) and their cover of the Broken Social Scene classic "Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl". My favorite songs off softscars right now are "ghosts" and "dazies", optimally back to back.

Honorable mention to [Confessions of a Rotten Girl / ft. Hatsune Miku](https://youtu.be/sV2H712ldOI) by SAWTOWNE on YouTube, an insane mashup of things that make my brain very happy.

#### Now Watching: Right now? Nothing really.

I don't really have anything in particular I am watching, TV or movie wise. The last show I watched was Hibike! Euphonium (which I loved immensely).

My favorite video essays lately have been [Testosterone: A Love Story](https://youtu.be/1CMcBp3Aysg) by RickiHirsch, and [CONSPIRACY](https://youtu.be/teqkK0RLNkI) by contrapoints. Both are well worth your time.

#### Now Reading: The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson

Book 5 in my favorite fantasy series came out late last year and so I've been re-reading from the beginning. Its a very slow process.
