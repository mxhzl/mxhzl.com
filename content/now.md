#### Now Playing (music): [The Mind Electric](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-mind-electric/938227937?i=938233090) by Miracle Musical

This song came up randomly in shuffle on Apple Music one day and I was instantly fascinated and confused. If you listen to any of it you will see why. The first half of the song is the second half but reversed. I like it a lot. It sounds haunting and cursed but also beautiful in its own way. I haven't listened to the rest of Hawaii Part II so I don't know how the rest of the album holds up. But The Mind Electric is great.

The keen eyed among you will have noticed that my current project is _also_ called The Mind Electric. Thats because I love the song, and its about electroshock therapy and mental illness ([maybe?](https://www.reddit.com/r/miraclemusical/comments/1iyf4k8/title/)). I am going to make a proper post about this soon, but The Mind Electric is a website I am making to supplement my work in therapy. It is going to house hopefully a bunch of tools that will help track my progress in my own _mental health journey_. So the website is The Mind Electric because its an electric tool or the mind? Or something like that. I just really liked the [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Sing_the_Body_Electric) mostly and there is a line in the song "See how the brain plays around" which I think works as a slogan for the site.

Honorable mention to [Melanie Martinez](https://music.apple.com/us/album/void/1680490456?i=1680490658) and [PUP](https://music.apple.com/us/album/paranoid/1784974039?i=1784974040) who have also been on repeat recently.

#### Now Watching: Game Changer, Parlor Room, and Smartypants

I have been a subscriber to [Dropout](https://www.dropout.tv/browse) for many years and everything they put out is gold. They are easily the best media company on the internet by a mile. Recently I have been catching up on Smartypants, where comedians give extremely well thought out (/s) powerpoint presentations on various topics. I also really like Parlor Room where [Becca Scott](https://www.instagram.com/thebeccascott/) hosts board game nights. Its only two episodes in so far but I am a sucker for board games. And of course, there is a new season of Game Changer airing right now. Game Changer is the only game show where the game changes every show and its probably my favorite thing on the internet right now.

#### Now Reading: The Terraformers by Annalee Newitz

I have been working and traveling a lot so I haven't had time to read but I really like what I've read so far! I temporarily gave up on re-reading The Stormlight Archive for now because reading 5 books in a row that all start at over 350,00 words each was a little overwhelming. I will definitely return to them though. I need to read book 5.
