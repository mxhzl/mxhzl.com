I run a couple different services at the moment:

- [pronouns.mxhzl.com](https://pronouns.mxhzl.com): After [pronoun.is](https://pronoun.is/) went down, [Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/) made a [spiritual successor](https://github.com/Xe/pronouns) and had hosted an [instance](https://pronouns.within.lgbt), but it has, ironically, also gone down. So I just threw their docker image on my server just because. If any of those links are unbroken at any point, let me know and I will take my instance down in favor of theirs. Otherwise please feel free to use!
- [git.mxhzl.com](https://git.mxhzl.com/): A [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) installation I use for hosting my code projects. Any code on my GitHub account is just mirrored from forgejo. This will probably be mostly private for the foreseeable future, but who knows I might allow more users on if the right person wants to join.
- [links.mxhzl.com](https://links.mxhzl.com): My [linkding](https://linkding.link/) instance that I use as a link collector. This will probably always be private, sorry. I might think about enabling public links for sharing purposes eventually but not right now.
- [The Mind Electric](https://git.mxhzl.com/mxhzl/mind-electric): I am building a web app to help in doing [CBT thought logging](https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-wellbeing-tips/self-help-cbt-techniques/thought-record/). I do thought logging sometimes with my therapist and having a web form to fill out would be nicer than doing it on paper or trying to wrangle a word doc or something. Currently this lives at [mood.mxhzl.com](https://mood.mxhzl.com/). I am still actively working on it, but theoretically one day I could see possibly opening up registration to other people. The name comes from a [song](https://genius.com/Miracle-musical-the-mind-electric-lyrics) I really like.

Others:

- [Old] [ikukani](https://git.mxhzl.com/mxhzl/ikukani): Long ago, during one of my attempts to learn Japanese, I build a little cli for interfacing with [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/). I used it to send text notifications when my reviews were ready. By now its super old and unmaintained. It has several dependabot alerts that I might not get around to fixing. I am probably going to just re-write the whole thing.
