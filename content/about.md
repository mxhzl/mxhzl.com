Hi! My name is Maxine and I am a computer programmer with an interest in web apps, systems, and infrastructure management (which is a fancy way of saying I like to build Linux servers and then tear them down again).

This website is still relatively new, but I am hoping to make it my home on the internet. I will probably write about tech stuff when I have something interesting to say, but also about other nerd things when I feel like it. Don't expect any consistency from me here.

If you are interested, you can also take a look [here](@/uses.md) to checkout the types of things I use on a daily basis.

I keep a list of my tasks [here](@/todo.md).

To see what I am up to right now go [here](@/now.md).

If you are wanting to hire me, my resume is [here](@/resume.md).

If you want to poke around some of my active projects, I list them out [here](@/projects.md).
