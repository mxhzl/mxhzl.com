I fell down a deep wikipedia rabbit hole last night and discovered that there are different words for words for a large numbers like billion and million. In some countries like the US, 1,000,000,000 (10<sup>9</sup>) is a billion, but in some other countries, mostly Europe I think, 1,000,000,000,000 (10<sup>12</sup>) is a billion. Apparently the latter is the historical definition for a billion.

Apparently this is because different countries use the [long scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales) or [short scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales) naming systems for powers of ten. For example, the US, the UK, and Ireland all use the short scale, while Germany, the Netherlands, and France use long scale. And of course countries like Japan and China have completely different number naming systems.

Of exceptional note is Canada who uses _both_ long scale and short scale depending on what language is being spoken! Wild!

This is ridiculous. We should standardize these things and/or all use the metric system.

More info on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales).
