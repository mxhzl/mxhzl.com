I don't really know why, but I feel compelled to keep a public tracker of my tasks. None of this is legally binding, mind you, but I figured it might be useful as some form of accountability.

<div id="todolist">

- [ ] CBT thought log web app
- [ ] Re-write ikukani
- [ ] Figure out my task management system even if I have to make one myself.
- [ ] Firefox extension that allows me to add all open tabs to linkding

- [x] Finish this todo page

- [x] Add a [\/now](https://nownownow.com/about) page
- [x] Finish the [uses](@/uses.md) page
- [x] I'd like a way to deploy this site from another machine, like a github action or something (I ended up writing a [script](https://git.mxhzl.com/mxhzl/mxhzl.com/src/branch/main/deploy.sh) but may revisit this in the future).
- [x] Finish writing my resume
- [x] then either upload it here or recreate it in html
- [x] Write some posts so I have actual content.
- [x] Write post about NixOs testing
- [x] Scrap my neovim setup and start from scratch. (I tried this and it was overwhelming)
- [x] Play around with deploying linkding and forgejo to digitalocean (located at [git.mxhzl.com](https://git.mxhzl.com) and [links.mxhzl.com](https://links.mxhzl.com/))

For some of my code repos, I will sometimes check in a `.taskpaper` file that contains my to do list for that project specifically. If you are sneaky you can find them on my git hosting places.
