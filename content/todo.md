I don't really know why, but I feel compelled to keep a public tracker of my tasks. None of this is legally binding, mind you, but I figured it might be useful as some form of accountability.

<div id="todolist">

- [ ] CBT thought log web app
- [x] ~Finish this todo page~
- [x] ~Set up and try out [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding)~
- [x] ~Add a [\/now](https://nownownow.com/about) page~
- [x] ~Finish the [uses](@/uses.md) page~
- [x] ~I'd like a way to deploy this site from another machine, like a github action or something~ (I ended up writing a [script](https://git.mxhzl.com/mxhzl/mxhzl.com/src/branch/main/deploy.sh) but may revisit this in the future).
- [x] ~Finish writing my resume~
- [x] ~then either upload it here or recreate it in html~
- [x] ~Write some posts so I have actual content.~
- [x] ~Write post about NixOs testing~
- [x] ~Scrap my neovim setup and start from scratch.~ (I tried this and it was overwhelming)
- [x] ~Play around with deploying linkding and forgejo to digitalocean~ (located at [git.mxhzl.com](https://git.mxhzl.com) and [links.mxhzl.com](https://links.mxhzl.com/))
